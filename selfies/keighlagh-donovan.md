She is passport #srs; straight lips, not *that* straight; white background, white skin, white wounds. 4-year-old, 16-year-old, 25-year-old complex traumatized selves surface in her faintly freckled 30-something-year-old nose bridging the [eye]sle of crow's feet and grief-infused pools of blue. Brows the colour of drugstore Medium Brown and a Wal-Mart rouge they bought sometime this Century BC (Before Covid). Zoomed in: a delicate gold chain rests on the collar of her blouse/fine-knit pairing, features water-carrying Aquarius; signals her indifference; reveals their devastating desire for meaningful connection: Is this angle good enough? Is this lighting good enough? Is she/her/they?
